# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
`cd`:
  1. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ cd | Output: [user@sahara ~]$`. This command was run in the `/home` directory. No changes occured because `cd` is the command to change directory and when no parameters are given, `cd` just changes the current working directory to  `/home`. This is why when the command is run from a different directory, the terminal just changes the current working directory to `/home`. This is not an error because `cd` is built to change directories and return to the home directory when nothing is given as input.
  2. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ cd /home/lecture1/messages/ | Output: [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$`. This command was initially run in the `/home` directory but led into the `/home/lecture1/messages/` directory after being executed. This occured because `cd` tells the terminal to change directories and the terminal was given an absolute path into the messages folder. If the relative path `lecture1/messages` was used, after being executed, the current working directory would also be `/home/lecture1/messages/`. This is not an error because the command performed exactly as expected and changed the directory to the one indicated in the prompt.
  3. `Input: [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd/de.txt | Output: bash: cd: de.txt: Not a directory`. The command was run in the `/home/lecture1/messages` directory. Although the syntax of the command was correct, the output is such because it is not possible to change directories to a file. This is an error because the `cd` command takes the user to a specific directory where files and folders and other content can be worked on. However, a file itself, is not a directory because for example, a folder or another file can not be made inside the file. Therefore, because the command was pointed towards a specific file, it returned an error.

`ls`:
  1. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ ls | Output: lecture1`. The preceding command was run in the `/home/` directory and printed all the items present in the home folder. Because there is only the `lecture1` folder present, only that one string is shown. This is not an error because the command starts for `list` and is intended to show what is present in the directory. terminal outputed exactly what was expected.
  2. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1/ | Output: Hello.class Hello.java messages README`. This command was run from the `/home/` directory and after running, it outputted all the items present in the `lecture1` folder. This is not an error because looking at the folder can confirm that it only has the four files: `Hello.java`, `Hello.class`, `messages`, and `README`, and the out is also just the name of these four files.
  3. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ ls lecture1/Hello.class | Output: lecture1/Hello.class`. The command was run in the `/home/` directory. By giving a path to a file in the ls command, the output just simply echoes the path. The terminal just lists what was inputted when the path is to a file. This is not an error because the `ls` command is programmed tht way.

`cat`:
  1. `Input: [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ cat | Output: `. The working directory this command was run in was the `/home/lecture1/` directory. This command behaves unexpectadly as it does not output anything. After leaving it to run, the command just runs infinitely until it is manually stopped using `ctrl-c`. This is not an error as the terminal may be trying to access something that is not there indefinately causing the never-ending nothing.
  2. `Input: [user@sahara ~lecture1]$ cat messages/ | Output: cat: messages/: Is a directory`. This command was also tested in the `/home/lecture1/` directory. The command does not work but rather throws out an error. This error occurs because the `cat` command expects a file as it is used to display contents. Since in this instance the terminal recieved a directory instead of a file, it throws out the error statement that the input is a directory.
  3. `Input: [user@sahara ~lecture1]$ cat messages/de.txt | Output: Hallo Welt!`. Run in the same directory as others, `/home/lecture1/`, this command is the only one that displays a messages. The command outputs the contents of the file `de.txt`, as it was asked to. There is no error present here.
