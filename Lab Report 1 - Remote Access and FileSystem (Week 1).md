# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
`cd`:
  1. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ cd | Output: [user@sahara ~]$`. This command was run in the `/home` directory. No changes occured because `cd` is the command to change directory but it requires a directory to switch to. So by running just `cd`, the terminal does not know where to go and just stays in the current directory without changing anything. And if the command was run from a different directory, then the terminal would change the current working directory to `/home`. This is not an error because `cd` is built to do nothing when nothing follows the command when already in the home directory.
  2. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ cd /home/lecture1/messages/ | Output: [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$`. This command was initially run in the `/home` directory but led into the `/home/lecture1/messages/` directory after being executed. This occured because `cd` tells the terminal to change directories and the terminal was given an absolute path into the messages folder. If the relative path `lecture1/messages` was used, after being executed, the current working directory would also be `/home/lecture1/messages/`. This is not an error because the command performed exactly as expected and changed the directory to the one indicated in the prompt.
  3. `Input: [user@sahara ~/lecture1/messages]$ cd/de.txt | Output: bash: cd: de.txt: Not a directory`. The command was run in the `/home/lecture1/messages` directory. Although the syntax of the command was correct, the output is such because it is not possible to change directories to a file. This is an error because the `cd` command takes the user to a specific directory where files and folders and other content can be worked on. However, a file itself, is not a directory because for example, a folder or another file can not be made inside the file. Therefore, because the command was pointed towards a specific file, it returned an error.

`ls`:
  1. `Input: [user@sahara ~]$ ls | Output: lecture1`. The preceding command was run in the `/home/` directory and printed all the items present in the home folder. Because there is only the `lecture1` folder present, only that one string is shown. This is not an error because the command starts for `list` and is intended to show what is present in the directory. terminal outputed exactly what was expected.
